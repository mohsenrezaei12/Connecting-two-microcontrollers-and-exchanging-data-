# Connecting-two-microcontrollers-and-exchanging-data

In this project, we have two microcontrollers. Three potentiometers are connected to the first microcontroller. And a keyboard and display are connected to the second microcontroller. The potentiometer voltage is transferred to the second microcontroller, and the LCD displays it by pressing the keypad.
